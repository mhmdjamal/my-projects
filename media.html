        Lucas Vázquez scored Real Madrid's second goal of the night against
        Sevilla just three minutes after coming off the bench. The academy
        graduate reflected: “It was a tough match for us. We're pleased to clinch
        this hard-fought victory and now we have to keep winning games. We'll work
        hard to make sure we keep this up for the whole season. Getting the better
        of direct rivals really gives the team a boost mentally”.
