      Lucas Vázquez scored Real Madrid's second goal of the night against
      Sevilla just three minutes after coming off the bench. The academy
      graduate reflected: “It was a tough match for us. We're pleased to clinch
      this hard-fought victory and now we have to keep winning games. We'll work
      hard to make sure we keep this up for the whole season. Getting the better
      of direct rivals really gives the team a boost mentally”.
